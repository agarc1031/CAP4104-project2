# 🥗 Welcome to Our App, Healthy Bites!

Designed with Streamlit, Healthy Bites lets users search for any food item and view comprehensive nutritional information driven by the Nutritionix API.  The app shows calories, sugar, fiber, fat, protein, and a personalized health score based on nutrient data, therefore guiding users in making better food decisions.

Healthy Bites is designed for individuals who value their nutrition and need quick access to food statistics. This includes consumers attempting to eat healthier, people with dietary issues such as diabetes or IBS, and fitness or wellness enthusiasts. The app is designed to deliver an instructive and visual experience to its users by giving them a health score and nutrient breakdown they can quickly understand. 

The goal of Healthy Bites is to give its users quick and easy access to nutritional facts so that they can make better health choices when it comes to their food. The health score and nutritional images help to simplify complicated data.
